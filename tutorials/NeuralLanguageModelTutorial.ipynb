      "chapter UNK when he was dressed stepan arkadyevitch sprinkled some scent on himself pulled down his shirt cuffs distributed into his pockets his UNK pocketbook UNK and watch with its double chain and UNK and shaking out his handkerchief feeling himself clean UNK healthy and UNK at ease in spite of his unhappiness he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining room where coffee was already waiting for him and beside the coffee letters and papers from the office\n",

      "one was very unpleasant from a merchant who was UNK a forest on his wife s property\n",
      "to UNK this forest was absolutely essential but at present until he was reconciled with his wife the subject could not be discussed\n",

      "and the idea that he might be led on by his interests that he might seek a reconciliation with his wife on account of the sale of the forest that idea hurt him\n",
      "when he had finished his letters stepan arkadyevitch moved the office papers close to him rapidly looked through two pieces of business made a few notes with a big pencil and pushing away the papers turned to his coffee\n",
      "as he UNK his coffee he opened a still UNK morning paper and began reading it\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch took in and read a liberal paper not an extreme one but one UNK the views held by the majority\n",
      "and in spite of the fact that science art and UNK had no special interest for him he firmly held those views on all these UNK which were held by the majority and by his paper and he only changed them when the majority changed them or more strictly speaking he did not change them but they UNK changed of themselves within him\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch had not chosen his political opinions or his views these political opinions and views had come to him of themselves just as he did not choose the UNK of his hat and coat but simply took those that were being worn\n",
      "and for him living in a certain society owing to the need UNK developed at years of UNK for some degree of mental activity to have views was just as UNK as to have a hat\n",
      "if there was a reason for his UNK liberal to conservative views which were held also by many of his circle it arose not from his UNK liberalism more UNK but from its being in closer accordance with his manner of life\n",
      "the liberal party said that in russia everything is wrong and certainly stepan arkadyevitch had many debts and was decidedly short of money\n",
      "the liberal party said that marriage is an institution quite out of date and that it needs UNK and family life certainly afforded stepan arkadyevitch little gratification and forced him into lying and UNK which was so repulsive to his nature\n",
      "the liberal party said or rather allowed it to be understood that UNK is only a UNK to keep in check the UNK classes of the people and stepan arkadyevitch could not get through even a short service without his legs UNK from standing up and could never make out what was the object of all the terrible and high UNK language about another world when life might be so very amusing in this world\n",
      "and with all this stepan arkadyevitch who liked a joke was fond of UNK a plain man by saying that if he UNK himself on his origin he ought not to stop at UNK and UNK the first founder of his family the UNK\n",
      "and so liberalism had become a habit of stepan arkadyevitch s and he liked his newspaper as he did his cigar after dinner for the slight UNK it UNK in his UNK\n",
      "he read the leading article in which it was maintained that it was quite UNK in our day to raise an UNK that UNK was UNK to UNK up all conservative elements and that the government ought to take measures to UNK the UNK UNK that on the contrary in our opinion the danger lies not in that UNK UNK UNK but in the UNK of UNK UNK progress etc\n",
      "etc\n",
      "he read another article too a financial one which alluded to UNK and UNK and dropped some UNK UNK on the ministry\n",
      "with his characteristic UNK he caught the UNK of each UNK UNK UNK it came at whom and on what ground it was UNK and that afforded him as it always did a certain satisfaction\n",
      "but today that satisfaction was UNK by matrona philimonovna s advice and the unsatisfactory state of the household\n",
      "he read too that count UNK was UNK to have left for UNK and that one need have no more gray hair and of the sale of a light carriage and of a young person seeking a situation but these items of information did not give him as usual a quiet UNK gratification\n",
      "having finished the paper a second cup of coffee and a roll and UNK he got up shaking the UNK of the roll off his waistcoat and UNK his broad chest he smiled joyously not because there was anything particularly agreeable in his mind the joyous smile was evoked by a good UNK\n",

      "everything s in confusion thought stepan arkadyevitch there are the children running about by themselves\n",
      "and going to the door he called them\n",
      "they threw down the box that represented a train and came in to their father\n",
      "the little girl her father s favorite ran up boldly embraced him and hung laughingly on his neck enjoying as she always did the smell of scent that came from his whiskers\n",
      "at last the little girl kissed his face which was flushed from his stooping UNK and beaming with tenderness UNK her hands and was about to run away again but her father held her back\n",
      "how is mamma\n",
      "he asked passing his hand over his daughter s smooth soft little neck\n",
      "good morning he said smiling to the boy who had come up to greet him\n",

      "well is she cheerful\n",
      "the little girl knew that there was a quarrel between her father and mother and that her mother could not be cheerful and that her father must be aware of this and that he was UNK when he asked about it so lightly\n",
      "and she blushed for her father\n",
      "he at once perceived it and blushed too\n",
      "i don t know she said\n",
      "she did not say we must do our lessons but she said we were to go for a walk with miss UNK to UNK s\n",
      "well go tanya my darling\n",
      "oh wait a minute though he said still holding her and stroking her soft little hand\n",
      "he took off the mantelpiece where he had put it yesterday a little box of UNK and gave her two picking out her UNK a UNK and a UNK\n",
      "for grisha\n",
      "said the little girl pointing to the UNK\n",
      "yes yes\n",

      "been here long\n",
      "asked stepan arkadyevitch\n",
      "half an hour\n",
      "how many times have i told you to tell me at once\n",
      "one must let you drink your coffee in peace at least said matvey in the UNK UNK tone with which it was impossible to be angry\n",
      "well show the person up at once said oblonsky frowning with UNK\n",
      "the petitioner the widow of a staff captain UNK came with a request impossible and UNK but stepan arkadyevitch as he generally did made her sit down heard her to the end attentively without UNK her and gave her detailed advice as to how and to whom to UNK and even wrote her in his large UNK good and UNK hand a confident and UNK little note to a UNK who might be of use to her\n",
      "having got UNK of the staff captain s widow stepan arkadyevitch took his hat and stopped to UNK whether he had forgotten anything\n",
      "it appeared that he had forgotten nothing except what he wanted to forget his wife\n",
      "ah yes\n",
      "he bowed his head and his handsome face assumed a UNK expression\n",
      "to go or not to go\n",
      "he said to himself and an inner voice told him he must not go that nothing could come of it but UNK that to UNK to set right their relations was impossible because it was impossible to make her attractive again and able to inspire love or to make him an old man not UNK to love\n",
      "except UNK and lying nothing could come of it now and UNK and lying were opposed to his nature\n",
      "it must be some time though it can t go on like this he said trying to give himself courage\n",

      "hearing her husband s steps she stopped looking towards the door and trying UNK to give her features a severe and UNK expression\n",
      "she felt she was afraid of him and afraid of the coming interview\n",
      "she was just UNK to do what she had UNK to do ten times already in these last three days to sort out the children s things and her own so as to take them to her mother s and again she could not bring herself to do this but now again as each time before she kept saying to herself that things cannot go on like this that she must take some step to UNK him put him to shame UNK on him some little part at least of the suffering he had caused her\n",
      "she still continued to tell herself that she should leave him but she was conscious that this was impossible it was impossible because she could not get out of the habit of UNK him as her husband and loving him\n",
      "besides this she realized that if even here in her own house she could hardly manage to look after her five children properly they would be still worse off where she was going with them all\n",
      "as it was even in the course of these three days the youngest was unwell from being given UNK soup and the others had almost gone without their dinner the day before\n",
      "she was conscious that it was impossible to go away but UNK herself she went on all the same UNK out her things and UNK she was going\n",
      "seeing her husband she dropped her hands into the UNK of the bureau as though looking for something and only looked round at him when he had come quite up to her\n",

      "the UNK UNK in stepan arkadyevitch which had gained him this universal respect in the service consisted in the first place of his extreme UNK for others founded on a consciousness of his own shortcomings secondly of his perfect liberalism not the liberalism he read of in the papers but the liberalism that was in his blood in virtue of which he treated all men perfectly UNK and exactly the same whatever their fortune or calling might be and UNK the most important point his complete indifference to the business in which he was engaged in consequence of which he was never carried away and never made mistakes\n",

      "one of the members going down a UNK official with a portfolio stood out of his way and looked UNK at the legs of the stranger then glanced inquiringly at oblonsky\n",

      "he said with a friendly mocking smile scanning levin as he approached\n",
      "how is it you have deigned to look me up in this UNK\n",
      "said stepan arkadyevitch and not content with shaking hands he kissed his friend\n",
      "have you been here long\n",
      "i have just come and very much wanted to see you said levin looking UNK and at the same time angrily and UNK around\n",
      "well let s go into my room said stepan arkadyevitch who knew his friend s sensitive and irritable shyness and taking his arm he drew him along as though UNK him through UNK\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch was on familiar terms with almost all his acquaintances and called almost all of them by their christian names old men of UNK boys of twenty UNK ministers UNK and adjutant generals so that many of his intimate chums were to be found at the extreme UNK of the social UNK and would have been very much surprised to learn that they had through the medium of oblonsky something in common\n",
      "he was the familiar friend of everyone with whom he took a glass of champagne and he took a glass of champagne with everyone and when in consequence he met any of his UNK chums as he used in joke to call many of his friends in the presence of his subordinates he well knew how with his characteristic tact to UNK the disagreeable impression made on them\n",
      "levin was not a UNK UNK but oblonsky with his ready tact felt that levin fancied he might not care to show his intimacy with him before his subordinates and so he made haste to take him off into his room\n",
      "levin was almost of the same age as oblonsky their intimacy did not rest merely on champagne\n",
      "levin had been the friend and companion of his early youth\n",
      "they were fond of one another in spite of the difference of their UNK and UNK as friends are fond of one another who have been together in early youth\n",
      "but in spite of this each of them as is often the way with men who have UNK UNK of different kinds though in discussion he would even justify the other s career in his heart despised it\n",
      "it seemed to each of them that the life he led himself was the only real life and the life led by his friend was a mere UNK\n",
      "oblonsky could not UNK a slight mocking smile at the sight of levin\n",
      "how often he had seen him come up to moscow from the country where he was doing something but what precisely stepan arkadyevitch could never quite make out and indeed he took no interest in the matter\n",
      "levin arrived in moscow always excited and in a hurry rather ill at ease and irritated by his own want of ease and for the most part with a perfectly new UNK view of things\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch laughed at this and liked it\n",
      "in the same way levin in his heart despised the town mode of life of his friend and his official duties which he laughed at and regarded as UNK\n",
      "but the difference was that oblonsky as he was doing the same as everyone did laughed UNK and good humoredly while levin laughed without UNK and sometimes angrily\n",
      "we have long been expecting you said stepan arkadyevitch going into his room and letting levin s hand go as though to show that here all danger was over\n",
      "i am very very glad to see you he went on\n",
      "well how are you\n",
      "eh\n",
      "when did you come\n",
      "levin was silent looking at the unknown faces of oblonsky s two companions and especially at the hand of the elegant grinevitch which had such long white fingers such long yellow UNK shaped nails and such huge shining studs on the shirt UNK that apparently they absorbed all his attention and allowed him no freedom of thought\n",
      "oblonsky noticed this at once and smiled\n",
      "ah to be sure let me UNK you he said\n",
      "my colleagues UNK UNK nikitin UNK UNK grinevitch and turning to levin a district UNK a modern district UNK a UNK who UNK UNK stone with one hand a cattle UNK and UNK and my friend konstantin dmitrievitch levin the brother of sergey ivanovitch koznishev\n",
      "delighted said the veteran\n",
      "i have the honor of knowing your brother sergey ivanovitch said grinevitch holding out his slender hand with its long nails\n",
      "levin frowned shook hands coldly and at once turned to oblonsky\n",
      "though he had a great respect for his half brother an author well known to all russia he could not UNK it when people treated him not as konstantin levin but as the brother of the UNK koznishev\n",
      "no i am no longer a district UNK\n",
      "i have quarreled with them all and don t go to the meetings any more he said turning to oblonsky\n",
      "you ve been quick about it\n",
      "said oblonsky with a smile\n",
      "but how\n",
      "why\n",
      "it s a long story\n",
      "i will tell you some time said levin but he began telling him at once\n",
      "well to put it shortly i was convinced that nothing was really done by the district UNK or ever could be he began as though someone had just UNK him\n",
      "on one side it s a UNK they play at being a parliament and i m neither young enough nor old enough to find amusement in UNK and on the other side he UNK it s a means for the UNK of the district to make money\n",
      "UNK they had UNK courts of justice now they have the district council not in the form of UNK but in the form of UNK salary he said as UNK as though someone of those present had opposed his opinion\n",
      "UNK\n",
      "you re in a new phase again i see a conservative said stepan arkadyevitch\n",
      "however we can go into that later\n",
      "yes later\n",
      "but i wanted to see you said levin looking with hatred at grinevitch s hand\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch gave a scarcely perceptible smile\n",
      "how was it you used to say you would never wear UNK dress again\n",
      "he said scanning his new suit obviously cut by a french UNK\n",
      "ah\n",
      "i see a new phase\n",
      "levin suddenly blushed not as grown men UNK slightly without being themselves aware of it but as boys UNK feeling that they are ridiculous through their shyness and consequently ashamed of it and blushing still more almost to the point of tears\n",
      "and it was so strange to see this sensible manly face in such a childish UNK that oblonsky left off looking at him\n",
      "oh where shall we meet\n",
      "you know i want very much to talk to you said levin\n",
      "oblonsky seemed to UNK\n",
      "i ll tell you what let s go to UNK s to lunch and there we can talk\n",
      "i am free till three\n",
      "no answered levin after an instant s thought i have got to go on somewhere else\n",
      "all right then let s dine together\n",
      "dine together\n",
      "but i have nothing very particular only a few words to say and a question i want to ask you and we can have a talk afterwards\n",
      "well say the few words then at once and we ll UNK after dinner\n",
      "well it s this said levin but it s of no importance though\n",
      "his face all at once took an expression of anger from the effort he was making to UNK his shyness\n",
      "what are the shtcherbatskys doing\n",
      "everything as it used to be\n",
      "he said\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch who had long known that levin was in love with his sister in law kitty gave a hardly perceptible smile and his eyes sparkled UNK\n",
      "you said a few words but i can t answer in a few words because\n",
      "excuse me a minute\n",
      "a secretary came in with respectful familiarity and the modest consciousness characteristic of every secretary of superiority to his chief in the knowledge of their business he went up to oblonsky with some papers and began under UNK of asking a question to explain some objection\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch without hearing him out laid his hand UNK on the secretary s sleeve\n",
      "no you do as i told you he said UNK his words with a smile and with a brief explanation of his view of the matter he turned away from the papers and said so do it that way if you please UNK UNK\n",
      "the secretary retired in confusion\n",
      "during the UNK with the secretary levin had completely recovered from his embarrassment\n",
      "he was standing with his elbows on the back of a chair and on his face was a look of UNK attention\n",
      "i don t understand it i don t understand it he said\n",
      "what don t you understand\n",
      "said oblonsky smiling as brightly as ever and picking up a cigarette\n",
      "he expected some queer UNK from levin\n",
      "i don t understand what you are doing said levin shrugging his shoulders\n",
      "how can you do it seriously\n",
      "why not\n",
      "why because there s nothing in it\n",
      "you think so but we re overwhelmed with work\n",
      "on paper\n",
      "but there you ve a gift for it added levin\n",
      "that s to say you think there s a lack of something in me\n",
      "perhaps so said levin\n",
      "but all the same i admire your UNK and am proud that i ve a friend in such a great person\n",
      "you ve not answered my question though he went on with a UNK effort looking oblonsky straight in the face\n",
      "oh that s all very well\n",
      "you wait a bit and you ll come to this yourself\n",
      "it s very nice for you to have over six thousand acres in the UNK district and such muscles and the freshness of a girl of twelve still you ll be one of us one day\n",
      "yes as to your question there is no change but it s a pity you ve been away so long\n",
      "oh why so\n",
      "levin queried panic stricken\n",
      "oh nothing responded oblonsky\n",
      "we ll talk it over\n",
      "but what s brought you up to town\n",
      "oh we ll talk about that too later on said levin UNK again up to his ears\n",
      "all right\n",
      "i see said stepan arkadyevitch\n",
      "i should ask you to come to us you know but my wife s not quite the thing\n",
      "but i tell you what if you want to see them they re sure now to be at the UNK gardens from four to five\n",
      "kitty skates\n",
      "you drive along there and i ll come and UNK you and we ll go and dine somewhere together\n",
      "capital\n",
      "so good bye till then\n",
      "now mind you ll forget i know you or rush off home to the country\n",
      "stepan arkadyevitch called out laughing\n",
      "no truly\n",
      "and levin went out of the room only when he was in the doorway remembering that he had forgotten to take leave of oblonsky s colleagues\n",
      "that gentleman must be a man of great energy said grinevitch when levin had gone away\n",
      "yes my dear boy said stepan arkadyevitch UNK his head he s a lucky fellow\n",
      "over six thousand acres in the UNK district everything before him and what youth and UNK\n",
      "not like some of us\n",
      "you have a great deal to complain of haven t you stepan arkadyevitch\n",
      "ah yes i m in a poor way a bad way said stepan arkadyevitch with a heavy sigh\n",
      "chapter UNK when oblonsky asked levin what had brought him to town levin blushed and was UNK with himself for blushing because he could not answer i have come to make your sister in law an offer though that was precisely what he had come for\n",
      "the families of the UNK and the shtcherbatskys were old noble moscow families and had always been on intimate and friendly terms\n",
      "this intimacy had grown still closer during levin s student days\n",
      "he had both prepared for the university with the young prince shtcherbatsky the brother of kitty and dolly and had entered at the same time with him\n",
      "in those days levin used often to be in the shtcherbatskys house and he was in love with the shtcherbatsky household\n",
      "strange as it may appear it was with the household the family that konstantin levin was in love especially with the feminine half of the household\n",
      "levin did not remember his own mother and his only sister was older than he was so that it was in the shtcherbatskys house that he saw for the first time that inner life of an old noble cultivated and honorable family of which he had been UNK by the death of his father and mother\n",
      "all the members of that family especially the feminine half were pictured by him as it were wrapped about with a mysterious poetical veil and he not only perceived no UNK whatever in them but under the poetical veil that UNK them he assumed the existence of the UNK UNK and every possible perfection\n",
      "why it was the three young ladies had one day to speak french and the next english why it was that at certain hours they played by turns on the UNK the sounds of which were UNK in their brother s room above where the students used to work why they were visited by those professors of french UNK of music of drawing of dancing why at certain hours all the three young ladies with UNK linon drove in the UNK to the UNK UNK dressed in their satin UNK dolly in a long one natalia in a half long one and kitty in one so short that her UNK legs in tightly drawn red stockings were visible to all UNK why it was they had to walk about the UNK UNK escorted by a footman with a gold UNK in his hat all this and much more that was done in their mysterious world he did not understand but he was sure that everything that was done there was very good and he was in love precisely with the mystery of the proceedings\n",
      "in his student days he had all but been in love with the eldest dolly but she was soon married to oblonsky\n",
      "then he began being in love with the second\n",
      "he felt as it were that he had to be in love with one of the sisters only he could not quite make out which\n",
      "but natalia too had hardly made her appearance in the world when she married the UNK UNK\n",
      "kitty was still a child when levin left the university\n",
      "young shtcherbatsky went into the UNK was UNK in the UNK and levin s relations with the shtcherbatskys in spite of his friendship with oblonsky became less intimate\n",
      "but when early in the winter of this year levin came to moscow after a year in the country and saw the shtcherbatskys he realized which of the three sisters he was indeed destined to love\n",
      "one would have thought that nothing could be UNK than for him a man of good family rather rich than poor and thirty two years old to make the young princess shtcherbatskaya an offer of marriage in all UNK he would at once have been looked upon as a good match\n",
      "but levin was in love and so it seemed to him that kitty was so perfect in every respect that she was a creature far above everything earthly and that he was a creature so low and so earthly that it could not even be conceived that other people and she herself could regard him as worthy of her\n",
      "after spending two months in moscow in a state of UNK seeing kitty almost every day in society into which he went so as to meet her he abruptly decided that it could not be and went back to the country\n",

      "an ugly good natured man as he considered himself might he supposed be liked as a friend but to be loved with such a love as that with which he loved kitty one would need to be a handsome and still more a distinguished man\n",
      "he had heard that women often did care for ugly and ordinary men but he did not believe it for he UNK by himself and he could not himself have loved any but beautiful mysterious and exceptional women\n",
      "but after spending two months alone in the country he was convinced that this was not one of those UNK of which he had had experience in his early youth that this feeling gave him not an instant s rest that he could not live without UNK the question would she or would she not be his wife and that his despair had UNK only from his own UNK that he had no sort of UNK that he would be UNK\n",
      "and he had now come to moscow with a firm determination to make an offer and get married if he were accepted\n",

      "with him there was a well known professor of UNK who had come from UNK expressly to clear up a difference that had UNK between them on a very important UNK question\n",

      "he UNK the professor of making too great UNK to the UNK\n",

      "levin sat down to wait till the professor should go but he soon began to get interested in the subject under discussion\n",
      "levin had come across the UNK articles about which they were UNK and had read them interested in them as a development of the first principles of science familiar to him as a natural science student at the university\n",
      "but he had never connected these scientific UNK as to the origin of man as an UNK as to UNK action UNK and UNK with those questions as to the meaning of life and death to himself which had of late been more and more often in his mind\n",
      "as he listened to his brother s UNK with the professor he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual UNK that at times they almost touched on the latter but every time they were close upon what seemed to him the chief point they promptly beat a UNK retreat and UNK again into a sea of subtle UNK UNK UNK UNK and appeals to authorities and it was with difficulty that he understood what they were talking about\n",
      "i cannot admit it said sergey ivanovitch with his habitual UNK precision of expression and elegance of UNK\n",

      "UNK indeed says plainly that UNK there are no sensations it follows that there is no idea of existence\n",
      "i maintain the contrary began sergey ivanovitch\n",
      "but here it seemed to levin that just as they were close upon the real point of the matter they were again retreating and he made up his mind to put a question to the professor\n",
      "according to that if my UNK are UNK if my body is dead i can have no existence of any sort\n",
      "he queried\n",
      "the professor in annoyance and as it were mental suffering at the UNK looked round at the strange UNK more like a UNK than a UNK and turned his eyes upon sergey ivanovitch as though to ask what s one to say to him\n",
      "but sergey ivanovitch who had been talking with far less heat and one UNK than the professor and who had sufficient UNK of mind to answer the professor and at the same time to comprehend the simple and natural point of view from which the question was put smiled and said that question we have no right to answer as yet\n",
      "we have not the UNK UNK UNK in the professor and he went back to his UNK\n",
      "no he said i would point out the fact that if as UNK directly UNK UNK is UNK on sensation then we are bound to UNK sharply between these two conceptions\n",

      "all i say is give such rights as our local self government to any other UNK people why the UNK or the english would have worked their way to freedom from them while we simply turn them into UNK\n",

      "he walked on a few steps and the skating ground lay open before his eyes and at once UNK all the skaters he knew her\n",
      "he knew she was there by the UNK and the terror that seized on his heart\n",
      "she was standing talking to a lady at the opposite end of the ground\n",
      "there was apparently nothing striking either in her dress or her attitude\n",

      "the place where she stood seemed to him a holy UNK UNK and there was one moment when he was almost retreating so overwhelmed was he with terror\n",
      "he had to make an effort to master himself and to remind himself that people of all sorts were moving about her and that he too might come there to skate\n",
      "he walked down for a long while UNK looking at her as at the sun but seeing her as one does the sun without looking\n",
